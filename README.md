# Strategy Design Pattern

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the Strategy design pattern, providing explanations and examples. The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that abstracts behaviors (strategies) by defining them through interfaces, allowing objects to change these behaviors at runtime.

## Problem

In software development, we often encounter situations where we need different variations of a functionality. In such cases, we might want to manage and switch between these variations using the same interface, but directly incorporating these functionalities into an object can lead to a closed and inflexible codebase.

## Solution: Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy design pattern allows us to abstract the different variations of functionalities into separate classes implementing a common interface. By doing so, we can switch between different strategies at runtime, making the object's behavior dynamically changeable.

## How It Works

- **Context**: The class that uses the Strategy design pattern. The Context contains a reference to the Strategy interface and invokes different strategies through this reference.

- **Strategy**: The interface that defines the methods for various strategies. Different variations of functionalities are represented using this interface.

- **Concrete Strategies**: The concrete implementations of different strategies. Each concrete strategy provides a different implementation of the methods defined in the Strategy interface.

## Examples

1. **Example 1: File Compression**

   This example simulates a program that compresses files using different compression algorithms. The `Context` class uses the `CompressionStrategy` interface to invoke different compression strategies. Classes like `ZipCompression` and `RarCompression` represent different compression algorithms and implement the `CompressionStrategy` interface.

2. **Example 2: Payment Methods**

   This example simulates a payment system that processes payments using different payment methods. The `PaymentProcessor` class uses the `PaymentStrategy` interface to invoke different payment strategies. Classes like `CreditCardPayment` and `PaypalPayment` represent different payment methods and implement the `PaymentStrategy` interface.

## How to Use

To use the Strategy design pattern in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Define the Strategy interface with methods representing the different variations of functionalities.

2. Implement concrete classes for each variation by providing distinct implementations for the methods defined in the Strategy interface.

3. Create the Context class that contains a reference to the Strategy interface.

4. Allow the Context class to set or switch between different strategies at runtime.
